ðŸ’¹ **Cryptocurrency Price Prediction using LSTM**

This project focuses on predicting the future prices of cryptocurrencies using historical market data and deep learning techniques. It uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to capture temporal patterns in crypto price trends.

ðŸŽ¯** Objective**

To build a deep learning model that predicts the closing price of a selected cryptocurrency, helping traders or analysts gain insights into future market movements.

ðŸ“ˆ **Data Source**

Source: CoinGecko API

Data Fetched:

Historical closing prices

Daily time interval

Crypto types: e.g., Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH)

ðŸ§° **Tools & Technologies**

Python â€“ Programming Language

Pandas, NumPy â€“ Data preprocessing

Matplotlib, Plotly â€“ Data visualization

TensorFlow / Keras â€“ Deep learning (LSTM modeling)

Scikit-learn â€“ Data scaling & evaluation metrics

Streamlit â€“ Web application for real-time predictions

CoinGecko API â€“ Real-time cryptocurrency data

ðŸ§  **Model Used: LSTM**

Used LSTM layers to capture long-term dependencies in time-series price data

Scaled data using MinMaxScaler

Used past 60 days of prices to predict the next dayâ€™s closing price

Split into training/testing datasets (80/20)

ðŸ“Š **Evaluation Metrics**

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Visual comparison of predicted vs. actual prices
